# Implementation

Implement the approved plan on a feature branch.

## Actions

1. Create a feature branch from main in a worktree
2. Implement changes following the plan while respecting all invariants
3. Write tests for all new behavior
4. Commit and push the feature branch

## Output

- Working implementation on feature branch
- All tests passing with coverage threshold met
- Handoff capsule with implementation summary
